# PersonalAssistant

This will be a multi-functional desktop assistant, capable of keeping you updated on your appointments, important dates, weather,
traffic near you and your work, sports scores, stocks, Crypto prices, and news important to the user among other things.

This project is very much a tool for learning for me. It may or may not be useful to someone in the future, but it will be useful for me,
and has already taught me a lot about databases (2/25/18). I would like to introduce some narrow ai into the program in the future; 
something that might be able to predict what kind of items you may want or need based off of your searches. It is really up in the air
right now what happens with this project.

I have finished integrating SQLite db into the project and will continue to work with it. At this point (2/25/18) I am about to begin
working with APIs such as the Python wrapper Forecast.io for weather, and Crypticker for Crypto.

Up to this point the only dependencies used have been SQLite, Requests, and BeautifulSoup4. I'm sure there will be more in the future. 



Thank you for checking out my project.
